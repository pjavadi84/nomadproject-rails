# nomadproject..extended!
In this repo, I want to expriment something interesting. Can we describe a house in a text, as much as or as least as detailed it can get, and then visualizing what that house with our desired feature within our desired neighborhood can be look like? how can it inspire me further to visualize how life can be within the context of the imagination. The more we manifest the better mental model we can gain in order to understand what a rener, a rentee, can visualize what they like so we can improve our market targets? You bet! 

# This is only an experiment..nothing to do with the interview assessment:
Using DAL-E from OpenAI we can send a description of a desired property in a region and provide the user with ideas of how the place they want to rent can look like. We can start simply by creating a form to submit data to the OpenAI API and can receive a response which can contain images with multiple variation using Dal-E's powerful models.
