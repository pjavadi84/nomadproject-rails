# nomadproject-rails
In this project, I tried to focus my effort of practicing on building an API that integrate with Picsum Photos API that fetch images on the UI written with React. The backend Rails api is also built for future data manipulation and creating models that can be useful for future extension of this project.

Furthermore when the image is being clicked, more details about the image itself can be rendered in a modal at the bottom of the page. 

#Project Scope & acceptance criteria:

### Image Preview

- Fetch 30 images and render each image in the Gallery so it includes the image and the author name

### Image Detailed View

- When a user clicks on an image, they should be taken to a detail view for that image which includes extended information such as `width`, `height`, `url` and `download_url`

### (Bonus) Image Search

- Implement a search box at the top of the Gallery
- As a user types, the list of images in the Gallery should filter based on the matching author name
