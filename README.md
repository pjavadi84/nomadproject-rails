# nomadproject-rails
In this project, I tried to focus my effort of practicing on building an API that integrate with Picsum Photos API that fetch 30 images that is being handled by React component and using hooks to manage the states.

Furthermore when the image is being clicked, more details about the image itself can be rendered in a modal at the bottom of the page.

The Rails API is also being built and a json representation of the data can also being rendered. It is specifically useful if I can maintain these images in database and making modifications if needed in the future.

Below is the instructions provided by Nomad:

# Photo Gallery Rails
An incomplete photo gallery

The following tools and libraries are preinstalled for you:

Ruby on Rails
Faraday
RSpec
A simple Picsum Photos API Client
Desired Features
Image Preview
Fetch 30 images and render each image in the Gallery so it includes the image and the author name
Image Detailed View
When a user clicks on an image, they should be taken to a detail view for that image which includes extended information such as width, height, url and download_url
(Bonus) Image Search
Implement a search box at the top of the Gallery
As a user types, the list of images in the Gallery should filter based on the matching author name


### Other projects to consider

# OpenAI..the next frontier? 
In terms of extending this project, I want to expriment something interesting. Can we describe a house in a text, as much as or as least as detailed it can get, and then visualizing what that house with our desired feature within our desired neighborhood can be look like? how can it inspire me further to visualize how life can be within the context of the imagination. The more we manifest the better mental model we can gain in order to understand what a rener, a rentee, can visualize what they like so we can improve our market targets? You bet! 

# This is only an experiment..nothing to do with the interview assessment:
Using DAL-E from OpenAI we can send a description of a desired property in a region and provide the user with ideas of how the place they want to rent can look like. We can start simply by creating a form to submit data to the OpenAI API and can receive a response which can contain images with multiple variation using Dal-E's powerful models.
