# nomadproject-rails
In this project, I tried to focus my effort of practicing on building an API that integrate with Picsum Photos API that fetch 30 images that is being handled by React component and using hooks to manage the states. 

Furthermore when the image is being clicked, more details about the image itself can be rendered in a modal at the bottom of the page. 

The Rails API is also being built and a json representation of the data can also being rendered. It is specifically useful if I can maintain these images in database and making modifications if needed in the future. 


Below is the instructions provided by Nomad: 

## Photo Gallery Rails

An incomplete photo gallery

The following tools and libraries are preinstalled for you:

- Ruby on Rails
- Faraday
- RSpec
- A simple [Picsum Photos API](https://picsum.photos) Client

## Desired Features

### Image Preview

- Fetch 30 images and render each image in the Gallery so it includes the image and the author name

### Image Detailed View

- When a user clicks on an image, they should be taken to a detail view for that image which includes extended information such as `width`, `height`, `url` and `download_url`

### (Bonus) Image Search

- Implement a search box at the top of the Gallery
- As a user types, the list of images in the Gallery should filter based on the matching author name
